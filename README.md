# Geotechnical Engineering
Geotechnical Engineering is an organization that try to enrich geotechnical engineers and make a community that help engineers to use coding and programming in their daily work.

In civil engineering and especially in geotechnical engineering, we have too many powerful and rich software, but many of them are closed source, and as an engineer must know whats going on, it can make things harder, and on the other side open source community has grown a lot and we have a lot of powerful tools that can make ground ready for have a community that engineers by themselves contribute in their tools that they use in their daily work, and read the code and understand whats going on.


## Why Geotechnical Engineering?
This community is founded by three geotechnical engineers, **Saman Yousefian**<Phd candidate>, **Milad Hasani** and **Mohammad ali mehdizadeh**, so we have a lot of experience in geotechnical engineering and we know what we need and what we can do to make things better.


### What we want to do?
It's an open community, so every one by it's own can create a project and invite others to contribute to it's project. Also we have done some works in some area of geotechnical engineering and we want to share them with others, so we will create some repositories and share them with others.
